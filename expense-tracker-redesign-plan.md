## Critical Path

The critical path for this project runs through:
1. Authentication setup (A1 → A2 → A3 → A4)
2. Core expense tracking functionality (B1 → B2)
3. OCR enhancement (C1 → C2 → C3 → C4)
4. Data visualization and reporting (D1 → D2 → D3)
5. Final optimization and testing (E1 → E2 → E3 → E4)

Any delays in these tasks will directly impact the project timeline.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Prioritize completing the Firebase Authentication migration to establish a solid foundation.

2. **OCR Processing**: Focus on both speed and accuracy improvements using AI providers, with a multi-provider strategy for optimal results.

3. **Mobile Experience**: Ensure the application works well on mobile devices, especially for receipt uploads.

4. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and implement caching to ensure good performance with large datasets.

5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and catch issues early.
