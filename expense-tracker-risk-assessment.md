## Top 5 High-Priority Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### 1. OCR Implementation Issues (TR-01)
**Risk Score: 9 (High Probability, High Impact)**

**Description:**  
The OCR implementation has been identified as a challenge in previous phases. The redesign involves integrating multiple AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude) for OCR processing, which adds complexity. Failures in OCR implementation would significantly impact the core expense tracking functionality.

**Preventive Measures:**
- Create a dedicated OCR testing environment with sample receipts of varying quality, formats, and languages
- Implement a provider-agnostic interface with standardized error handling and response formats
- Develop a comprehensive test suite covering edge cases and failure scenarios
- Implement graceful degradation when OCR fails or produces low-confidence results
- Create a structured approach to prompt engineering for each AI provider
- Establish a receipt classification system to route different receipt types to the most appropriate provider

**Contingency Plans:**
- Implement a fallback mechanism to automatically try alternative OCR providers when the primary one fails
- Create a manual review queue for failed OCR attempts with a simple admin interface
- Develop a simplified manual entry form as backup for when OCR is unavailable
- Maintain the current OCR implementation as a fallback option
- Create a mechanism to reprocess receipts when OCR improvements are made

**Monitoring Mechanisms:**
- Track OCR success/failure rates by provider, receipt type, and image quality
- Monitor processing times and error patterns to identify trends
