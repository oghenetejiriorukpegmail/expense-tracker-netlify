## Framework Evaluation and Recommendation

### Framework Comparison

| Criteria | React | Vue | Svelte |
|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| **Performance** | Good with optimizations | Very good | Excellent |
| **Bundle Size** | Larger (React + ReactDOM ~40KB gzipped) | Medium (Vue ~20KB gzipped) | Smallest (Svelte compiles away) |
| **Ecosystem** | Largest ecosystem, mature libraries | Growing ecosystem, good libraries | Smaller ecosystem, fewer specialized libraries |
| **TypeScript Support** | Excellent | Very good | Good, improving |
| **UI Component Libraries** | Abundant (Shadcn UI, MUI, etc.) | Good options (Vuetify, PrimeVue) | Fewer options (Skeleton, Svelte Material UI) |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Gentle | Gentle |
| **Maintainability** | Good with proper structure | Very good with composition API | Very good with simple syntax |
| **Mobile Performance** | Good with optimizations | Very good | Excellent |
| **SSR/SSG Support** | Next.js, Remix | Nuxt.js | SvelteKit |
| **Migration Effort** | None (current framework) | Moderate | Significant |

### Primary Recommendation: Svelte with SvelteKit

Svelte offers the best performance characteristics and smallest bundle size, which directly addresses our performance priorities. With SvelteKit, we get a full-featured framework with built-in routing, SSR, and other modern features.

Key advantages:
- Significantly smaller bundle size (critical for mobile performance)
- No virtual DOM overhead, resulting in faster rendering
- Built-in transitions and animations
- Less boilerplate code, improving maintainability
- Reactive by default, simplifying state management
- SvelteKit provides an excellent development experience

### Alternative Options

1. **Vue 3 with Nuxt 3**
   - Better performance than React
   - Less migration effort than Svelte
   - Strong TypeScript support
   - Good balance of features and simplicity

2. **Enhanced React Implementation**
   - Minimal migration effort
   - Familiar to team
   - Large ecosystem
   - Requires significant optimization work

## State Management Approach

### Framework-Specific Recommendations

#### For Svelte:
- **Local Component State**: Svelte's built-in reactivity with `$:` syntax
- **Global State**: Svelte stores (writable, readable, derived)
- **Server State**: SvelteKit's data loading or TanStack Query

#### For Vue:
- **Local Component State**: Vue's Composition API with `ref` and `reactive`
- **Global State**: Pinia (Vue's official state management library)
- **Server State**: VueQuery or Nuxt's built-in data fetching

#### For React:
- **Local Component State**: React's useState and useReducer hooks
- **Global State**: Zustand (current approach)
- **Server State**: TanStack Query (current approach)

### State Categories

1. **UI State**
   - Modal states
   - Sidebar state
   - Form states
   - Loading states

2. **Client State**
   - User settings
   - Theme preferences
   - Authentication state
   - Local cache

3. **Server State**
   - Expenses data
   - Trip data
   - User profile
   - Background tasks

### State Management Implementation

1. **Separate concerns by state type**
2. **Implement optimistic updates**
3. **Use persistent storage where appropriate**
4. **Implement proper TypeScript types**

### Component Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each component should do one thing well
   - Break down complex components into smaller ones

2. **Composition Over Inheritance**
   - Use composition for component reuse
   - Create higher-order components when needed

3. **Prop Drilling Avoidance**
   - Use context or state management for deeply nested data
   - Keep component hierarchy shallow when possible

4. **Consistent Naming**
   - Follow a consistent naming convention
   - Use clear, descriptive names

5. **Documentation**
   - Document component props and usage
   - Include examples and edge cases

## Routing Strategy

### Implementation by Framework

#### For Svelte (SvelteKit):
