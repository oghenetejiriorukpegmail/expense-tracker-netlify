# Decision Log

## Frontend Migration Decisions
- [2025-04-28 12:35:56] - Decision to verify the migration status from React/TypeScript to Svelte
  - Rationale: Need to ensure the codebase has been completely migrated to Svelte frontend
  - Implications: Will determine if additional migration work is needed

## Architecture Decisions
- [2025-04-28 12:35:56] - Decision to initialize memory bank for project context tracking
  - Rationale: Maintain consistent project context and track progress
  - Implications: Improved project documentation and context awareness
## Authentication Decisions
- [2025-04-28 13:53:11] - Decision to implement Firebase Authentication
  - Rationale: User request to replace the existing authentication system (likely Supabase Auth or Clerk).
  - Implications: Requires frontend and backend changes, installation of Firebase SDKs, configuration using project credentials, and eventual removal of old authentication code. Firebase will now handle user identity and session management.
