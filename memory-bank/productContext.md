# Product Context: Expense Tracker MVP with Supabase

## Project Overview
This is an expense tracking application built with Supabase as the backend. The application allows users to track expenses, manage trips, log mileage, and generate reports. The frontend appears to be in the process of migration from React/TypeScript to Svelte.

## Goals
- Provide a comprehensive expense tracking solution
- Enable trip management and mileage logging
- Support analytics and reporting features
- Migrate the frontend from React/TypeScript to Svelte

## Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Expense tracking and categorization
- Trip management
- Mileage logging
- Analytics and reporting
- OCR functionality for receipt scanning

## Architecture
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL database with RESTful API)
- Original Frontend: React/TypeScript
- Target Frontend: Svelte
- Deployment: Netlify

## Technical Stack
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- Backend: Supabase Functions, Node.js
- Original Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Target Frontend: Svelte, TypeScript
- UI Components: Custom components for both React and Svelte
- Authentication: Likely using Supabase Auth or possibly Clerk
- Deployment: Netlify

## Current Status
The project appears to be in the process of migrating from a React/TypeScript frontend to a Svelte frontend. Both codebases exist in the repository, with the React code in the `client/` directory and the Svelte code in the `src/` directory.
