# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Verifying the migration status of the codebase from React/TypeScript to Svelte
- Initializing the memory bank for project context tracking

## Recent Changes
- [2025-04-28 12:35:25] - Initialized memory bank with productContext.md
- [2025-04-28 12:39:09] - Verified that the codebase is in the process of migrating from React/TypeScript to Svelte. Both implementations currently exist in parallel, with React code in the `client/` directory and Svelte code in the `src/` directory.
- [2025-04-28 12:52:11] - Verified functionality of both context7 and sequential-thinking MCP servers. Both are operational and ready for use in future development tasks.

## Open Questions/Issues
- Are there any remaining components or pages that need to be migrated?
- Is the Svelte implementation fully functional and feature-complete compared to the React version?
## Current Focus
- Finalizing Firebase Authentication implementation and updating Memory Bank.

## Recent Changes
- [2025-04-28 13:53:43] - Implemented Firebase Authentication:
    - Installed `firebase` and `firebase-admin` SDKs.
    - Verified frontend Firebase configuration (`src/lib/firebase.ts`).
    - Verified frontend auth service (`src/lib/auth/auth-service.ts`).
    - Verified frontend auth store (`src/lib/stores/auth.ts`).
    - Created backend Firebase Admin SDK initialization (`server/firebase-admin.ts`).
    - Installed `dotenv` for backend environment variables.
    - Refactored backend authentication middleware (`server/middleware/auth-middleware.ts`) to use the centralized Admin SDK for token verification.
