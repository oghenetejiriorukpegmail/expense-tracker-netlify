# Progress Log

## Tasks
- [2025-04-28 12:36:11] - Started task to initialize memory bank and verify Svelte migration status
- [2025-04-28 12:36:11] - Created memory bank structure with initial files:

- [2025-04-28 12:39:53] - Completed verification of Svelte migration status. Found that the codebase is in the process of migrating from React/TypeScript to Svelte, with both implementations existing in parallel. React code is in the `client/` directory and Svelte code is in the `src/` directory. The migration is part of a planned redesign as documented in expense-tracker-redesign-plan.md.
