# Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Technical Plan for Expense Tracker Redesign

## 1. Executive Summary

The expense tracker application redesign aims to maintain the current functionality and frontend design while modernizing the tech stack and addressing key pain points, particularly the OCR processing for receipts. The redesign will leverage Supabase as the primary database and authentication provider, with a serverless architecture deployed on Netlify. The application will continue to provide comprehensive expense tracking, trip management, mileage logging, and data visualization capabilities, but with improved performance, reliability, and user experience.

## 2. Current Application Analysis

### Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand, React Query
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Deployment**: Netlify with serverless functions

### Main Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Trip management
- Expense tracking with receipt uploads
- OCR processing for receipts (identified as a pain point)
- Mileage logging
- Data visualization with charts
- Data export functionality
- Background task processing

### Pain Points
- OCR processing for receipts is slow and sometimes unreliable

## 3. Proposed Tech Stack with Justification

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (maintain current)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (maintain current)
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS (maintain current)
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state (maintain current)
- **Data Fetching**: React Query (maintain current)
- **Routing**: Wouter (maintain current)

### Backend
- **Architecture**: Serverless with Netlify Functions
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (with Row Level Security)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (replacing Clerk)
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (maintain current)
- **OCR Processing**: Specialized OCR service (Mindee, Document AI, or Amazon Textract)

### Justification
1. **Maintaining Frontend**: The current frontend design and functionality work well, so we'll maintain it to minimize disruption.
2. **Serverless Architecture**: Reduces operational complexity and improves scalability.
3. **Supabase Integration**: Provides a unified solution for database, authentication, and storage, simplifying the architecture.
4. **Specialized OCR Service**: Addresses the main pain point by providing more accurate and reliable OCR processing.
5. **Netlify Deployment**: Maintains the current deployment platform while leveraging its serverless capabilities.

```

This architecture follows a modern approach with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
   - React components for UI rendering
   - Custom hooks for reusable logic
   - Zustand for global state management
   - React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization

2. **Backend Layer (Serverless)**:
   - Netlify Functions as the API gateway
   - Authentication middleware for security
   - API routes for different resources
   - Controllers for handling requests
   - Services for business logic

3. **External Services**:
   - Supabase for database with Row Level Security
   - Supabase Auth for authentication and authorization
   - Supabase Storage for file storage
   - Specialized OCR service for receipt processing

        jsonb result
        string error
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at

```

Key changes from the current data model:

1. Using UUID as primary keys instead of serial integers for better security and distribution
2. Adding proper timestamps for start_date and end_date in the TRIPS table
3. Adding currency field to EXPENSES for international support
4. Using proper PostgreSQL data types (uuid, jsonb, etc.)
5. Maintaining all existing relationships
6. Ensuring proper foreign key constraints
