# Frontend Architecture

This document outlines the frontend architecture for the Expense Tracker application.

## Framework: SvelteKit

We've chosen SvelteKit as our frontend framework for the following reasons:

- **Performance**: Svelte compiles components to highly optimized vanilla JavaScript at build time, resulting in minimal runtime overhead.
- **Developer Experience**: Simple and intuitive API with less boilerplate compared to other frameworks.
- **File-based Routing**: SvelteKit's file-based routing system makes it easy to organize and navigate the application.
- **SSR/SSG Support**: Built-in support for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Small Bundle Size**: Svelte's approach results in smaller bundle sizes compared to other frameworks.

## State Management

We're using Svelte's built-in stores for state management:

- **Auth Store**: Manages authentication state (user, loading, error)
- **Derived Stores**: Convenience stores derived from the auth store (isAuthenticated, isLoading, etc.)
- **Component-level State**: Local state managed within components using Svelte's reactive declarations

This approach provides a simple and efficient way to manage state without the need for external libraries.

## Component Architecture

The application follows a hierarchical component structure:

1. **Layout Components**: Define the overall structure of the application
   - AppLayout: Main layout component that includes Header, Sidebar, and Footer
   - Header: Top navigation bar
   - Sidebar: Side navigation menu
   - Footer: Bottom footer section

2. **Page Components**: Represent different pages/routes in the application
   - Home: Landing page
   - Dashboard: Main dashboard
   - Auth: Authentication page (sign in, sign up, password reset)
   - Error: Error page for handling 404s and other errors

3. **Feature Components**: Components specific to features like expenses, trips, mileage, etc.
   - These will be organized by feature in the components directory

4. **UI Components**: Reusable UI components that can be used across the application
   - These will be organized in the components/ui directory

## Routing Strategy

We're using SvelteKit's file-based routing system:

- **Routes Directory**: Contains all the routes for the application
- **Layout Component**: Wraps all routes with the AppLayout component
- **Protected Routes**: Use the ProtectedRoute component to restrict access to authenticated users
- **Route Parameters**: Used for dynamic routes (e.g., /expenses/:id)

## API Integration

We've created a custom API client for interacting with the backend:

- **Base Client**: Handles common functionality like authentication, error handling, etc.
- **Convenience Methods**: Provides methods for common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Error Handling**: Custom ApiError class for handling API errors

## Authentication Flow

We're using Firebase Authentication:

1. **Sign Up**: User creates an account with email/password
2. **Sign In**: User signs in with email/password
3. **Auth State**: Auth state is managed in the auth store
4. **Protected Routes**: Routes that require authentication use the ProtectedRoute component
5. **Sign Out**: User signs out and is redirected to the home page

## Responsive Design

We're using a mobile-first approach with CSS:

- **Base Styles**: Define base styles for mobile devices
- **Media Queries**: Add styles for larger screens
- **Utility Classes**: Provide utility classes for common styling needs
- **CSS Variables**: Use CSS variables for consistent theming

## Performance Optimization

We're implementing several performance optimizations:

- **Code Splitting**: SvelteKit automatically splits code by route
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes are loaded on demand
- **Svelte's Compiler**: Svelte's compiler optimizes the code at build time
- **Minimal Dependencies**: We're keeping external dependencies to a minimum

## Accessibility Considerations

We're implementing several accessibility features:

- **Semantic HTML**: Using semantic HTML elements for better screen reader support
- **ARIA Attributes**: Adding ARIA attributes where necessary
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Color Contrast**: Ensuring sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements

## Testing Strategy

We'll implement the following testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test the application as a whole
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure the application is accessible

## Build and Deployment

We'll use the following build and deployment process:

1. **Development**: Local development using `npm run dev`
2. **Build**: Build the application using `npm run build`
3. **Preview**: Preview the build using `npm run preview`
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to a hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, etc.)
