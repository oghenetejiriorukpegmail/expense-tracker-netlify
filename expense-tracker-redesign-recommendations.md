## 6. Trade-offs and Considerations

### OCR Provider Strategy

**Options:**
1. **Multi-provider Strategy with Selection Algorithm (Recommended)**
   - Pros: Leverages strengths of each provider, fault tolerance, optimizes for speed/accuracy
   - Cons: More complex implementation, requires performance tracking

2. **Single Provider Strategy**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, consistent behavior
   - Cons: Single point of failure, may not be optimal for all receipt types

**Recommendation:** The multi-provider strategy with a selection algorithm provides the best balance of performance, accuracy, and reliability. By tracking performance metrics and selecting the optimal provider for each receipt type, we can achieve the target processing time while maintaining high accuracy.

### Authentication System

**Options:**
1. **Firebase Authentication (Recommended)**
   - Pros: Already partially implemented, robust features, good scalability, generous free tier
   - Cons: Separate service from database, more complex integration with Supabase

2. **Supabase Auth**
   - Pros: Integrated with database, Row Level Security, simpler architecture
   - Cons: Free plan limited to one session per user, paid plans required for scalability

**Recommendation:** Completing the migration to Firebase Authentication is the most practical approach given the current state of the application. It offers good scalability, a generous free tier, and robust features. The effort to complete the migration will be less than switching to a new authentication provider.

### Storage Layer Architecture

**Options:**
1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Pros: Clean separation of concerns, consistent interfaces, better testability
   - Cons: More boilerplate code, learning curve

2. **Direct Database Access (Current approach)**
   - Pros: Simpler, less code
   - Cons: Inconsistent implementations, duplicate code, harder to test

**Recommendation:** The repository pattern will provide better maintainability and testability, justifying the additional boilerplate code. It will also make it easier to implement consistent error handling and type safety.
